# `llvm` and `clang` packaging

Besides the guides for LLVM packaging linked below, LLVM package maintenance also requires staying up-to-date with several different communities.


## LLVM Community

- Join the [LLVM Discourse](https://discourse.llvm.org/), which has replaced most mailing lists for official upstream communication.
- (Optional) Subscribe to digest of LLVM changes, so that you don't need to follow every Github and Discourse discussion about a new feature. A good one is [llvmweekly.org](https://llvmweekly.org/).
- (Optional) Use of the [LLVM calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=calendar@llvm.org) to see office hours and other learning opportunities.


## Debian Community

- Register on [Debian Salsa](https://salsa.debian.org/), so that you can collaborate with Debian developers.
- Join appropriate Debian mailing lists, including the one dedicated to the LLVM packaging team: [pkg-llvm-team](https://alioth-lists.debian.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pkg-llvm-team).
- Join the [Debian IRC](https://wiki.debian.org/IRC) room for LLVM: [#debian-llvm](irc://irc.debian.org/debian-llvm).

  :::{note}
  As Ubuntu developers use Matrix, you can also join via a Matrix bridge. Follow the [instructions](https://wiki.debian.org/IRC/ElementMatrix) provided by Debian. Instead of the suggestion to use `!join`, join the corresponding Matrix room manually. For `#debian-llvm`, it is `#_oftc_#debian-llvm:matrix.org`.
